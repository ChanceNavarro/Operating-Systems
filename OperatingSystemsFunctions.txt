One operating system function is to establish a user-interface. 
This user-interface will allow the user to easily interact with the computer. 
The better the user-interface, the easier and more comfortable the experience.

Another operating system function is security. 
Security is essential to a computer; without it your data and access to your programs can be compromised by malicious people. 
This security can be established through password protection, network monitoring, etc.
