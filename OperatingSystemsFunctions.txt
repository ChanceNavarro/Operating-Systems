One operating system function is to establish a user-interface. 
This user-interface will allow the user to easily interact with the computer. 
The better the user-interface, the easier and more comfortable the experience.

Another operating system function is security. 
Security is essential to a computer; without it your data and access to your programs can be compromised by malicious people. 
This security can be established through password protection, network monitoring, etc. 

A third operating system function is File Management. 
An operating system should allow for organized files for efficient and intuitive navigation. 
Often through directories, an OS will keep track of where information is stored and cleanly allow the user access to this information and its status.
